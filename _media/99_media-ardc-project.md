excerpt: "Australian Research Data Commons Project."
excerpt_long: "<strong>The Challenge</strong> Marine imagery and annotation data on fish and shark assemblages provide powerful biodiversity reporting and impactful science communication. Established through GlobalArchive, the Australian Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) synthesis data asset has the potential to contribute the type of data used to illustrate climate change impacts, reveal environmental change within marine parks, and indicate pathways to maximise bio-economic management globally. However, more data is needed."
