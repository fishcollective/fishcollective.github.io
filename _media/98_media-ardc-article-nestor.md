title: "Why big fish thrive in protected oceans"
excerpt: "University of Western Australia"
excerpt_long: "Big fish are harder to find in areas sprawling with human activity, unless youâ€™re looking in no-take marine reserves, according to a new study led by marine scientists at The University of Western Australia.
The study, published in Conservation Biology, is one of the largest of its kind and assessed the body size of fish from around Australia, using more than 22,000 baited remote underwater video (BRUV) devices and one million measurements along 10,000km of coastline."
