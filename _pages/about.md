For more than a decade, a network of scientists using underwater imagery survey methods to survey fish and shark assemblages across Australia have been collaborating and sharing data under the informal banner of the ‘National BRUVs Working Group’. 

This group has used mono- and stereo-video imagery from [stereo-BRUV](https://benthic-bruvs-field-manual.github.io/) and [other platforms](https://rov-field-manual.github.io/) to inform [the discovery, description, and management of the marine environment](https://ardc.edu.au/article/watching-over-our-fish-and-sharks/). 

Through collaboration and the sharing of data the group has informed [local](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.uwa.edu.au/news/article/2021/may/marine-reserve-study-offers-insights-to-protect-ocean-life&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1755484489410891&usg=AOvVaw3dVnNOyUepMS1hJB3zuiAs), [national](https://www.uwa.edu.au/news/article/2021/july/why-big-fish-thrive-in-protected-oceans), and [international environmental reporting](https://www.uwa.edu.au/news/article/2020/july/global-survey-reveals-shark-populations-in-australia-are-among-the-healthiest), [management, and policy](https://globalfinprint.org/).

The National BRUVs Working Group held a workshop in New South Wales with three key objectives: 1) to broaden group membership and encourage greater collaboration, data standardisation, and sharing; 2) to establish and coordinate a cross-shelf national monitoring program for fish assemblages in coastal and Commonwealth waters; and 3) to support GlobalArchive as a data repository that promotes [FAIR](https://ardc.edu.au/resource-hub/making-data-fair/) and [CARE](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/the-care-principles/) principles for fish and shark assemblage data from underwater imagery. 

Recognising that other video-based sampling tools collect similar fish and shark data both nationally and internationally (including stereo-DOVs and stereo-ROVs), the Working Group expanded its scope and established The Fish Collective.


# Our Vision
---
<img style="max-width: 50%; float: right;" src="/assets/images/about/dov.jpg">
The Fish Collective advances the understanding and stewardship of marine ecosystems by coordinating a network of scientists who use underwater imagery to survey fish and shark assembalges, share data standards, and support collaboration, education, and training.
The Fish Collective actively governs and develops critical tools including GlobalArchive (an AI-ready data repository), CheckEM (an open-source toolkit for quality control of fish survey data), and advance methodologies that strengthen collaborative research and deepen our understanding and stewardship of marine ecosystems.

# Governance

<img style="max-width: 50%; float: right;" src="/assets/images/about/rov.jpg">
The Fish Collective operates under a Steering Committee with a diverse Working Group comprising representatives from research, monitoring, assessment, and management organisations across Australia, all experienced in underwater imagery survey methods of fish and sharks. 
The Working Group provides knowledge, expertise, and guidance to newcomers in imagery-based sampling while streamlining access to curated national and international datasets.
The Fish Collective's FAIR data will provide essential evidence to support Australian State of Environment reporting, State of the Australian Marine Park assessments, the development of National Ocean Ecosystem Accounts, and global biodiversity reporting initiatives.
