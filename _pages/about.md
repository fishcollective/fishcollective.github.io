For more than a decade, baited remote underwater (BRUV) users across Australia have been collaborating and sharing data under the informal banner of the ‘National BRUVs Working Group’. This group have used mono- and stereo-video imagery for the discovery, description, and management of the marine environment (Harvey et al. 2021) of fish and shark assemblages, and to characterise benthic biota (Langlois et al. 2021). Through collaboration and the sharing of data (FAIR principles, Wilkinson et al. 2015; CARE principles) the group have informed local, national, and international environmental reporting, management, and policy (e.g. MacNeil et al. 2020; Bosch et al. 2021; Goetze et al. 2021; Simpfendorfer et al. 2023; Goetze et al. 2024).

In November 2024, the National BRUVs Working Group held a workshop in New South Wales with two key goals: 

1) to broaden membership of the group, encourage greater collaboration, and data standardisation and sharing; and
2) to establish and coordinate a cross-shelf national monitoring program of fish assemblages across State and Commonwealth waters In recognition that there are other video based sampling tools that collect similar fish and habitat data (e.g. stereo-DOVs, Goetze et al. 2019; stereo-ROV, Jessop et al. 2022, Hellmrich et al. 2023; BOSS, Langlois et al 2025), the Working Group has rebranded to The Fish Collective.

# Our Vision

<img style="float: right;" src="/assets/images/Steve_Lindfield_BRUV.jpg">
The Vision of The Fish Collective is ‘to advance the understanding and management of marine ecosystems through the application of cutting-edge underwater imagery survey methods and analysis, robust data standards, education and training, advancing standardised and sustained monitoring of fish populations for sustainable ocean management’. Core foundations of The Fish Collective are standardisation and data sharing (involving continuous development and improvement), which facilitates adoption of national and international best-practice standards (Langlois et al. 2020) and the synthesis of image annotation for local, national, and global environmental reporting (Harvey et al. 2021). The Fish Collective is involved in the development and use of GlobalArchive, a centralised repository of national datasets, CheckEM, an open-source toolkit for quality control checks on fish survey data, updates to EventMeasure, a program used for logging and reporting events in imagery, and method advancements to benefit the collaborative research community.

# Governance

<img style="float: right;" src="/assets/images/Steve_Lindfield_BRUV.jpg">
The Fish Collective is governed by a Steering Committee and has a broad and diverse membership in its Working Group. Membership of the Working Group currently includes representatives from research, monitoring, assessment, and management organisations across Australia, experienced in the use of baited remote underwater video (BRUV) and the sharing of data collected by this method (previously referred to as the National BRUVs Working Group). Membership to The Fish Collective Working Group is being reviewed and expanded to better achieve the Vision (document in prep). The Fish Collective Working Group offers knowledge, expertise, and advice to any person or group new to the use of imagery-based sampling, ensuring awareness of and adherence to standards and protocols.
